Invoice Distribution Monitoring System

This project is a web-based monitoring system for employees who distribute invoices. It uses the Leaflet library to display the distribution zone as a marker on a map. All employees can log their activities as they enter the distribution zone, and the system records the time and duration of their work on each street.

As an administrator, you have access to all the entries made by your employees. You can use this information to monitor their activity and ensure they're working efficiently. Plus, the powerful search feature allows you to quickly find employees based on name, date, or activity duration.

This project is perfect for streamlining your invoice distribution process and keeping your employees accountable. Give it a try and see how it can improve your workflow!
